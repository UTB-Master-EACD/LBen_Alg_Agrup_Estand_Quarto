<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resumen"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Resumen</h2>
<p>Este documento implementa una metodología para la construcción de líneas base de consumo energético absoluto utilizando algoritmos de agrupación estándar.</p>
<p>Se identifican patrones de consumo mediante técnicas de clustering, agrupando períodos con comportamientos similares. Posteriormente, se validan estadísticamente los grupos obtenidos para garantizar su independencia y representatividad. Se incluye la posibilidad de editar manualmente los grupos en caso de que los resultados iniciales no sean óptimos, permitiendo refinamientos en la segmentación antes de proceder con los análisis finales.</p>
<p>Finalmente, se compara el modelo basado en clusters con el modelo tradicional de promedio global, evaluando su desempeño en términos de error. La justificación de esta metodología radica en que los modelos de línea base por cluster reflejan mejor la variabilidad operativa del consumo, reduciendo los sesgos introducidos por la heterogeneidad de los datos y proporcionando estimaciones más precisas para el cálculo de ahorros y sobreconsumos.</p>

<p>Eliminación de datos faltantes</p>
<p>Se eliminan los registros con datos faltantes, ya que no se emplearán algoritmos que requieran la continuidad de la serie temporal. Dado que el análisis se basa en agrupación por patrones de consumo y no en modelos secuenciales, la eliminación de estos valores no afecta la estructura del estudio. Esta limpieza mejora la calidad del dataset y evita sesgos en el proceso de clustering.</p>

<p>Se analizan las distribuciones de consumo energético para evaluar la representatividad de los datos. Aunque no es estrictamente necesario que los datos estén balanceados, es fundamental contar con la mayor cantidad de escenarios posibles (todas las horas y todos los días de la seman) para garantizar que los grupos obtenidos en el clustering tengan sentido operativo.</p>
<p>Además, se examina la influencia del mes en el consumo, ya que pueden existir patrones de largo plazo asociados a factores estacionales o a variaciones operativas temporales. En los casos de estudio analizados, la disponibilidad de datos es menor a un año.</p>

<p>Este paso analiza cómo varía el consumo energético a lo largo de las horas del día (distribución horaria), y luego compara estas distribuciones entre diferentes días. El objetivo es identificar si existen patrones recurrentes en el consumo durante ciertas horas y si estos patrones se mantienen consistentes entre días.</p>

<p>Este paso se enfoca en identificar valores atípicos en los datos (valores extremos que se desvían significativamente del resto de los datos). Se resalta que, antes de eliminarlos, es importante asegurarse de que no forman parte de un patrón recurrente. En este caso, los valores atípicos identificados son considerados errores puntuales que no reflejan patrones de comportamiento relevantes, por lo que se procede a su eliminación para evitar distorsionar el análisis.</p>

<p>Se normalizan los datos de consumo energético para asegurar que todas las variables utilizadas en el clustering tengan una escala comparable.</p>
<p>La normalización es un paso clave, ya que los algoritmos de agrupación son sensibles a las magnitudes de las variables. Se emplea la estandarización (Z-score) para centrar los datos en media cero y desviación estándar uno, permitiendo una mejor identificación de patrones sin sesgo por diferencias de escala.</p>

<p>Se determina el número óptimo de clusters utilizando tres métodos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Método del Codo (Elbow Method)</strong>: Evalúa la suma de los errores cuadráticos dentro de los grupos (<em>WSS</em>). Se busca el punto donde la reducción en la varianza comienza a estabilizarse, indicando un número adecuado de clusters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coeficiente de Silhouette</strong>: Mide la cohesión y separación de los grupos. Valores más altos indican una mejor estructura de agrupación.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estadística Gap (Gap Statistic)</strong>: Compara la dispersión intra-cluster con datos generados aleatoriamente para determinar si la estructura de los clusters es significativa.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Se presentan gráficos y tablas con los valores de <em>K</em> (número de clusters) junto con sus respectivas métricas (<em>WSS</em>, <em>Silhouette</em> y <em>Gap</em>). Estos resultados permiten seleccionar el número de grupos que mejor representa los patrones de consumo energético.</p>

<p>Para segmentar los datos, se utiliza el algoritmo <strong>K-Means</strong>, empleando el número óptimo de clusters determinado previamente</p>
<p>Aunque existen otros métodos como <strong>DBSCAN</strong> y <strong>HClust</strong>, se opta por K-Means debido a:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Eficiencia computacional</strong>: Es rápido y escalable, adecuado para datasets grandes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproducibilidad</strong>: Su implementación es sencilla y genera resultados consistentes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretabilidad</strong>: Produce clusters de forma compacta y fácilmente analizables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sin embargo, si se detectaran problemas como clusters mal definidos o sensibilidad a valores atípicos, podría considerarse una validación adicional con <strong>DBSCAN</strong> y <strong>HClust</strong> para verificar la estabilidad de la segmentación (metodo seleccionable en el código).</p>

<p>Una vez obtenidos los clusters, es necesario evaluar si existen diferencias estadísticas significativas entre ellos. Para esto, realizamos:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Pruebas de Normalidad (Shapiro-Wilk)</strong>: Determinan si la distribución del consumo dentro de cada grupo sigue una distribución normal. Esto es relevante porque muchas pruebas estadísticas requieren normalidad para su correcta aplicación.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prueba de Homocedasticidad (Levene)</strong>: Evalúa si la varianza entre los grupos es homogénea. La homocedasticidad es un supuesto clave en pruebas estadísticas como ANOVA, que se empleará posteriormente para validar la segmentación.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Estas pruebas permiten confirmar si los clusters obtenidos representan segmentos diferenciados en el consumo energético y si los datos cumplen con los supuestos necesarios para aplicar pruebas adicionales de significancia.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identificación de tendencias:</strong> Permite ver qué cluster domina en cada día y hora.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Análisis de estabilidad:</strong> Ayuda a evaluar si ciertos horarios tienen una clasificación clara o si presentan un comportamiento mixto.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimización de consumo:</strong> Se puede utilizar para ajustar estrategias de eficiencia energética basadas en los patrones de consumo detectados.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>La clasificación puede ajustarse según un <strong>umbral de probabilidad</strong>, lo que permite mayor flexibilidad en la segmentación de los clusters.</p>

<p>Con el apoyo de las <strong>tablas de franjas horarias</strong>, hemos identificado <strong>dos clusters principales</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Cluster de Baja Carga:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Se presenta principalmente en las <strong>horas nocturnas y tempranas de la mañana</strong> (<strong>0:00 - 8:00</strong>) y en la noche (<strong>20:00 - 23:00</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Es el patrón predominante durante los <strong>sábados</strong>, salvo un pequeño periodo de alta carga al <strong>mediodía</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster de Alta Carga:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ocurre en la <strong>franja diurna</strong> entre <strong>9:00 - 19:00</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Se observa de manera constante de <strong>lunes a viernes</strong> y también el <strong>domingo</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Durante el <strong>sábado</strong>, este patrón solo aparece alrededor del <strong>mediodía</strong>, pero el resto del día se comporta como baja carga.</p></li>

<p>Después de analizar y visualizar la matriz de franjas horarias, es útil poder <strong>descargar</strong> los resultados para su revisión y posterior edición. Luego, si se requieren ajustes, podemos <strong>cargar un archivo editado</strong> para actualizar los clusters según las modificaciones realizadas.</p>

<p>Este proceso permite mayor flexibilidad para realizar cambios manuales y asegurarse de que la segmentación sea representativa del comportamiento real del consumo energético.</p>

<p>El análisis de resultados seguirá una estructura similar a la aplicada a los datos sin editar, pero ahora considerando las franjas horarias ajustadas. El objetivo principal de esta edición es mejorar la uniformidad de los grupos, asegurando una mayor correspondencia con los horarios y características del proceso operativo.</p>
<p>Es importante destacar que, a pesar de los ajustes, los grupos deben seguir siendo independientes y mantener su coherencia estadística. Se busca que la segmentación refleje de manera más precisa los patrones de consumo y permita una mejor interpretación de los datos dentro del contexto del análisis energético.</p>
<p>Finalmente, el ajuste de las franjas horarias tiene como propósito optimizar la clasificación de los periodos de consumo, garantizando que estos se alineen con la operación real del sistema y que las pruebas estadísticas sean aplicadas con una base más representativa y consistente.</p>

<p>En esta fase, preparamos los datos para la construcción de los modelos de Línea Base (LB) de consumo absoluto. Este paso es fundamental para establecer una referencia sólida que permita evaluar el desempeño energético y cuantificar ahorros o sobreconsumos con base en los datos históricos.</p>
<section id="objetivo-del-paso" class="level4" data-number="11.0.1">
<h4 data-number="11.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objetivo-del-paso"><span class="header-section-number">11.0.1</span> <strong>Objetivo del Paso:</strong></h4>
<p>Generar indicadores de consumo promedio en distintos niveles de agregación, permitiendo una comparación estructurada entre los valores originales y los ajustados según la segmentación de franjas horarias.</p>
</section>
<section id="metodología-aplicada" class="level4" data-number="11.0.2">
<h4 data-number="11.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metodología-aplicada"><span class="header-section-number">11.0.2</span> <strong>Metodología Aplicada:</strong></h4>
<p>Para cada observación en el dataset, se calculan tres tipos de promedios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Promedio Total:</strong> Representa el consumo medio de todo el conjunto de datos, proporcionando una referencia general.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster:</strong> Calcula el consumo promedio dentro de cada cluster identificado originalmente, capturando patrones de consumo específicos de los grupos detectados.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster Editado:</strong> Ajusta el cálculo del promedio con base en las franjas horarias editadas, lo que permite evaluar el impacto de la refinación de los grupos en la homogeneidad de los consumos.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Esta preparación de datos es clave para la construcción de modelos más precisos y alineados con las condiciones operativas del proceso, asegurando que los clusters mantengan su independencia y coherencia en términos de consumo energético.</p>
<p>El siguiente paso será evaluar estadísticamente estos valores y utilizarlos en la modelación de las Líneas Base.</p>

<p>En esta sección, presentamos la tabla de errores de cada modelo de Línea Base (LB) con el objetivo de comparar su precisión y estabilidad.</p>
<section id="objetivo-del-paso-2" class="level4" data-number="11.2.1">
<h4 data-number="11.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objetivo-del-paso-2"><span class="header-section-number">11.2.1</span> <strong>Objetivo del Paso:</strong></h4>
<p>Analizar las métricas de error de cada modelo para evaluar cuál ofrece una mejor representación del consumo real y cuál minimiza la variabilidad en los residuos.</p>
</section>
<section id="métricas-evaluadas" class="level4" data-number="11.2.2">
<h4 data-number="11.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="métricas-evaluadas"><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2</span> <strong>Métricas Evaluadas:</strong></h4>
<p>Para cada modelo, se calculan los siguientes indicadores de error:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation):</strong> Promedio de los valores absolutos de los residuos, mide la dispersión respecto a la referencia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):</strong> Error absoluto porcentual medio, útil para evaluar la precisión relativa del modelo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):</strong> Raíz del error cuadrático medio, otorga mayor peso a los errores grandes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Desviación Estándar de los Residuos (STD_Residuos):</strong> Evalúa la dispersión de los errores en cada modelo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bias:</strong> Promedio de los residuos, indica si el modelo tiende a sobrestimar o subestimar el consumo.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="comparación-de-modelos" class="level4" data-number="11.2.3">
<h4 data-number="11.2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparación-de-modelos"><span class="header-section-number">11.2.3</span> <strong>Comparación de Modelos:</strong></h4>
<p>Se presentan los resultados para los tres modelos evaluados:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Promedio Total (LB General)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster (LB Clusterizado)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster Editado (LB con Franjas Ajustadas)</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Esta comparación permite identificar si el modelo con clusters editados mejora la uniformidad en la segmentación del consumo y reduce la variabilidad en los errores, ajustándose mejor a las condiciones operativas del proceso.</p>

<p>Para complementar el análisis de los modelos de Línea Base (LB) y su distribución de residuos, presentamos una tabla con estadísticas descriptivas clave.</p>

<h4 data-number="11.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objetivo-de-la-tabla"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.1</span> <strong>Objetivo de la Tabla:</strong></h4>
<p>Esta tabla permite evaluar cuantitativamente la distribución de los residuos para cada modelo, ayudando a identificar cuál de ellos ofrece una mejor estimación del consumo real.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Se calculan los residuos para cada modelo de LB.</p></li>
<li><p>Se obtienen las siguientes métricas clave:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mínimo y Máximo</strong>: Valores extremos de los residuos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q1 (Cuartil 1) y Q3 (Cuartil 3)</strong>: Límite inferior y superior del rango intercuartil (IQR).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mediana</strong>: Valor central de la distribución.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IQR (Rango Intercuartil)</strong>: Medida de dispersión entre Q1 y Q3.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SD (Desviación Estándar)</strong>: Cuantifica la variabilidad total de los residuos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sesgo (Skewness)</strong>: Indica si la distribución de los residuos está sesgada hacia valores positivos o negativos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Curtosis</strong>: Mide la forma de la distribución, indicando si hay colas más pesadas o ligeras que una distribución normal.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Un menor IQR y SD indican que los residuos están más concentrados en torno al valor esperado.</p></li>
<li><p>Un sesgo cercano a 0 sugiere una distribución simétrica de los residuos, lo que es deseable.</p></li>
<li><p>Una curtosis cercana a 3 indica que la distribución de los residuos es similar a una normal. Valores muy altos sugieren la presencia de valores extremos (colas pesadas).</p></li>
<li><p>Comparando los modelos, podemos determinar cuál presenta una mejor distribución de residuos y validar las conclusiones obtenidas en los pasos anteriores.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Esta tabla refuerza el análisis previo, proporcionando una base estadística sólida para elegir el modelo de LB más adecuado.</p>

<p>La metodología aplicada permite construir líneas base de consumo energético a partir de diferentes niveles de agregación, proporcionando un marco flexible para evaluar el desempeño energético de un edificio o proceso. A lo largo del análisis, se han implementado modelos basados en:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Promedio General</strong>: Representa una referencia global del consumo energético sin considerar particularidades operativas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster</strong>: Introduce una segmentación basada en patrones de consumo, permitiendo una mejor representación de la variabilidad inherente al proceso.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promedio por Cluster Editado</strong>: Ajusta la segmentación para mejorar la correspondencia con los horarios operativos y lograr una mayor homogeneidad dentro de cada grupo.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>El uso de métricas de error y análisis estadístico de los residuos ha permitido evaluar la precisión y utilidad de cada modelo. Además, los boxplots y sus respectivas tablas de estadísticos proporcionan una visión clara sobre la dispersión y distribución de los residuos, lo que facilita la selección de la línea base más adecuada.</p>
<p>En términos generales, esta metodología permite:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adaptar las líneas base a la estructura operativa del proceso, mejorando la precisión en la identificación de ahorros o sobreconsumos.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluar el impacto de la segmentación en la reducción del error del modelo.</p></li>
<li><p>Proporcionar un marco analítico reproducible para la validación de datos y toma de decisiones en eficiencia energética.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Este análisis sienta las bases para futuras conclusiones, donde se comparará el desempeño de cada modelo y se seleccionará el más adecuado en función de criterios de error y estabilidad.</p>
